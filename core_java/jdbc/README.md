#Introduction
`jdbc` is a Java application that allows users to connect to a PostgreSQL database and create, update, read, and delete data from its tables.

This project is a learning exercise built to understand JDBC (**J**ava **D**ata**b**ase **C**onnectivity), a platform-independent Java API used to connect and execute queries within databases. It implements create, update, read, and delete (CRUD) functionality through design patterns Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Data Access Objects (DAOs).

Note: This project was created by following Frank Moley's [Learning JDBC](https://www.lynda.com/Java-tutorials/Learning-JDBC/779748-2.html) course available on learning platform Lynda.
